# RappyTestPascal
This repository was published to expose a small test where the goal was to deliver the result and mainly to explore some capabilities of Delphi RTTI

The biggest problem was that Embarcadero provided only the trial version Starter Edition, without Database capabilities.
In this case ZeosLib was used for connections to the Database.
